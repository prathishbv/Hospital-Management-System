# File Structure and explanation
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have used Tkinter package to design all the pages used in this application. This application requires a username and password to log in. You can either log in as a doctor or as a patient. If you log in as a doctor you can set available timings, patient list who made appointment
, and send a medical report of the patient to their registered email as mail. When you log in as a patient, you can choose the available timing of the doctor, enter patient details, and make an appointment. We used the 'localhost' MySQL server for the database.

# Points to note:
- This might not be a full-fledged project.
- It can be extendable if needed.
- Since we have converted this into an exe file, this can be used without having the python interpreter.
- If you need to know about how every sector works in this application, you might need a python interpreter and the required modules (mentioned in requirements.txt).
- This can only work in an environment with a MySQL server (local or remote).
- Also we have given static values in the database as it is for development purposes. Database creation also needs to be done manually with specific filled values.
